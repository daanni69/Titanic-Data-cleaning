# Titanic Data Analysis

This project performs data cleaning, transformation, and visualization on a sample Titanic dataset. The goal is to demonstrate basic data manipulation and visualization techniques using Python and popular libraries like `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning**:
  - Handle missing values by replacing them with appropriate statistics (e.g., median, mode).
  - Drop columns with excessive missing data.
  - Convert columns to appropriate data types (e.g., categorical, boolean).
  - Remove duplicate rows.
  - Rename columns for consistency.

- **Data Visualization**:
  - Plot the count of survivors vs. non-survivors.
  - Create a barplot of average age by passenger class.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
